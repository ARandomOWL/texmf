  abstract	= {â€” Dual-rail code, return-to-spacer protocol and
		  hazard-free logic is used to make power consumption of
		  synchronous circuits inde-pendent from data processed. A
		  new compact dual-rail flip-flop is de-signed, whose power
		  consumption is also data-independent. A method for negative
		  gate optimisation of dual-rail logic is described, which
		  re-sults in faster and smaller circuits. A tool for
		  dual-rail circuit optimi-sation is developed. The tool is
		  interfaced to the Cadence CAD system. Dual-rail and
		  single-rail benchmarks are simulated and compared.},
