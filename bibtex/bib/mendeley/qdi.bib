@Article{	  Chang2017,
  abstract	= {NULL Convention Logic (NCL) is a promising design paradigm
		  for constructing low-power robust asynchronous circuits.
		  The conventional NCL paradigm requires pipeline registers
		  for separating two neighboring logic blocks, and those
		  registers can account for up to 35{\%} of the overall power
		  consumption of the NCL circuit. This brief presents the
		  Register-Less NCL (RL-NCL) design paradigm, which achieves
		  low power consumption by eliminating pipeline registers,
		  simplifying the control circuit, and supporting
		  fine-grained power gating to mitigate the leakage power of
		  sleeping logic blocks. Compared with the conventional NCL
		  counterpart, the RL-NCL implementation of an 8-bit
		  five-stage pipelined Kogge-Stone adder can reduce power
		  dissipation by 56.4{\%}-72.5{\%} for the input data rate
		  ranging from 10 to 900 MHz. Moreover, the RL-NCL
		  implementation can reduce the transistor count of the adder
		  by 49.5{\%}.},

		  in an NCL system. We show that a 16×16 non-pipelined NCL
		  multiplier achieves a throughput of nearly 260 Mops/sec,
		  with a latency of around 1.20 ns. By including 15 pipeline
		  stages, the multiplier throughput can be more than doubled
		  to 609 Mops/sec while the latency increases to only 2.26
		  ns. This can be contrasted with the corresponding
		  synchronous multiplier incorporating the same number of

  abstract	= {Designing asynchronous circuits by reusing existing
		  synchronous tools has become a promising solution to the
		  problem of poor CAD support in asynchronous world. A
		  straightforward way is to structurally map the gates in a
		  synchronous netlist to their functionally equivalent
		  modules which use delay-insensitive codes. Different
		  trade-offs exist in previous methods between the overheads
		  of the implementations and their robustness. The aim of
		  this paper is to optimise the area of asynchronous circuits
		  using partial acknowledgement concept. We employ this
		  concept in two design flows, which are implemented in a
		  software tool to evaluate the efficiency of the method. The
		  benchmark results show the average reduction in area by
		  28{\%} and in the number of inter-functional module wires
		  that require timing verification by 67{\%}, compared to
