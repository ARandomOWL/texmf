  abstract	= {Modern hardware systems are required to be robust,
		  resilient and long-life, thus they have to be adaptive to
		  changing requirements and operating conditions. This covers
		  not only the data processing functions but also control and
		  timing/power operation. For example, such systems will be
		  increasingly powered by ambient sources (energy harvesting)
		  and will experience a wide range of modes, including not
		  only dynamic voltage scaling but even power supplies which
		  do not deliver a stable Vdd level. Asynchronous circuits
		  offer ultimate robustness under extreme variations caused
		  by unstable power supply; however, the robustness often
		  comes at the price of a heavy/slow implementation. This may
		  be the only option for the extreme operating conditions,
		  but is unacceptable for the normal operation mode of the
		  system (in which it may be running most of the time). There
		  is clearly a need to choose a particular circuit
		  implementation in run-time rather than in design time. In
		  this paper we present and investigate a new methodology
		  which provides a way of building adaptive asynchronous
		  circuits supporting a range of power and timing modes of
		  operation (possibly even synchronous modes) that can be
		  selected during run-time according to the known hardware,
		  environmental, and power/latency budget requirements.},

@Article{	  Mokhov2010,
  abstract	= {The paper introduces a new formal model for specification
		  and synthesis of control paths in the context of
		  asynchronous system design. The model, called Conditional
		  Partial Order Graph (CPOG), captures concurrency and choice
		  in a system's behavior in a compact and efficient way. It
		  has advantages over widely used interpreted Petri Nets and
		  Finite State Machines for a class of systems which have
		  many behavioral scenarios defined on the same set of
		  actions, e.g., CPU microcontrollers. The CPOG model has
		  potential applications in the area of microcontrol
		  synthesis and brings new methods for modeling concurrency
		  into the application domain of modern and future processor
		  architectures. The paper gives the formal definition of the
		  CPOG model, formulates and solves the problem of CPOG
		  synthesis, and introduces various optimization techniques.
		  The presented ideas can be applied for CPU control
		  synthesis as well as for synthesis of different kinds of
		  event-coordination circuits often used in data coding and
		  communication in digital systems, as demonstrated with
		  several application examples.},
