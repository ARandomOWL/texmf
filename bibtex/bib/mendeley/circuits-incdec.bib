  abstract	= {This paper presents a very fast yet low power pseudo
		  incrementer structure which may be used in address bus
		  encoders/decoders. This structure, which is based on the
		  ripple carry incrementer, is much faster than the
		  incrementer. Using this structure, the delay and the power
		  of address bus encoders/decoders may be reduced
		  considerably. Analytical and synthesis results show that
		  the structure is faster than current incrementer circuits
		  while its circuit area and power are much smaller than
		  those of current fast incrementers. {\textcopyright} 2006
