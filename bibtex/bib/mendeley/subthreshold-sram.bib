@inproceedings{Andersson2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.A 128Ã—32 bit ultra-low power (ULP) memory with one read and one write port is presented. A full-custom standard-cell compliant dual-bit latch with two integrated NAND-gates was designed. The NAND-gate realizes the first stage of a read multiplexer. A dense layout reduces the physical cell area by 56 {\%}, compared to a pure commercial standard-cell equivalent. Effectively, an overall memory area reduction of 32{\%}is achieved. The gates are integrated into a digital standard-cell based memory (SCM) flow. Silicon measurements show correct read and write operation deep in the subthreshold domain (sub-VT), down to 370mV, and data is retained down to 320mV. At the energy minimum voltage (450 mV) the memory dissipates 35 fJ/operation.},

@article{Baz2011,
abstract = {Portable digital systems tend to be not just low power but power effi - cient as they are powered by low batteries or energy harvesters . Energy harvest - ing systems tend to provide nondeterministic , rather than stable , power over time . Existing memory systems use delay elements to cope with the problems under different Vdds . However , this introduces huge penalties on performance , as the delay elements need to follow the worst case timing assumption under the worst environment . In this paper , the latency mismatch between memory cells and the corresponding controller using typical delay elements is investigated and found to be highly variable for different Vdd values . A Speed Independent (SI) SRAM memory is then developed which can help avoid such mismatch problems . It can also be used to replace typical delay lines for use in bundled - data memory banks . A 1Kb SI memory bank is implemented based on this method and analysed in terms of the latency and power consumption .},

@article{Andersson2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.In this study, design considerations for ultra low voltage (ULV) standard-cell based memories (SCM) are presented. Trade-offs for area cost, leakage power, access time, and access energy are discussed and realized using different read logic styles, latch architecture designs, and process options. Furthermore, deployment of multiple threshold voltages (Vth) options in a single standard-cell/bitcell enables additional architectural choices. Silicon measurements from five memory designs, optimized at the transistor level in conjunction with gate-level optimizations, are considered to demonstrate the different trade-off corners. Measurements show that substituting the storage element in an SCM with a D-latch using transistor stacking and channel length stretching results in lowest leakage power. Alternatively, a pass-transistor based latch as storage element reduces the area footprint at a cost of reduced access speed, which can be compensated by using a lower- Vth pass-transistor. However, relatively high speed (tens of MHz) in the near- to subthreshold (Vth) region is achievable if general purpose transistors are used instead of low power transistors. A discussion is included to illustrate when to implement ULV memories using SCMs and when to choose sub- Vth SRAMs. The discussion shows that the border is between 4-6 kb, depending on the number of words and the wordlength configuration.},
