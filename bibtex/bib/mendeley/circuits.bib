		  so does the demand of asynchronous systems that can
		  function under low and variable power conditions. In
		  designing asynchronous logic, hand-shaking protocols are
		  required in order to preserve a form of synchronization.
		  The single most common method, for acknowledgment (ACK)
		  generation, is the use of delay blocks but this can
		  sometimes prove both unreliable and incompetent in terms of
		  performance. The following paper proposes the design of a

@Article{	  Mokhov2010,
  abstract	= {Ultra low-power design and energy harvesting applications
		  require digital systems to operate under extremely low
		  voltages approaching the point of balance between dynamic
		  and static power consumption which is attained in the
		  sub-threshold operation mode. Delay variations are
		  extremely large in this mode, which calls for the use of
		  asynchronous circuits that are speed-independent or
		  quasi-delay-insensitive. However, even these classes of
		  asynchronous logic become vulnerable because certain timing
		  assumptions commonly accepted under normal operating
		  conditions are no longer valid. In particular, the delay of
		  inverters, often used as the so-called inpububbles', can no
		  longer be neglected and they have to be either removed or
		  properly acknowledged to ensure speed-independence. This
		  paper presents an automated approach to synthesis of robust
		  controllers for sub-threshold digital systems based on
		  dual-rail implementation of control logic which eliminates
		  inverters com-pletely. This and other important properties
		  are analysed and compared to the standard single-rail
		  solutions. Dual-rail controllers are shown not to have
		  signicant overheads in terms of area and power consumption
		  and are even faster in some cases due to the elimination of
		  inverters from critical paths. The presented automated
		  techniques are very ecient and can be applied to very large
		  controllers as demonstrated in benchmarks.},

  abstract	= {Designing asynchronous circuits by reusing existing
		  synchronous tools has become a promising solution to the
		  problem of poor CAD support in asynchronous world. A
		  straightforward way is to structurally map the gates in a
		  synchronous netlist to their functionally equivalent
		  modules which use delay-insensitive codes. Different
		  trade-offs exist in previous methods between the overheads
		  of the implementations and their robustness. The aim of
		  this paper is to optimise the area of asynchronous circuits
		  using partial acknowledgement concept. We employ this
		  concept in two design flows, which are implemented in a
		  software tool to evaluate the efficiency of the method. The
		  benchmark results show the average reduction in area by
		  28{\%} and in the number of inter-functional module wires
		  that require timing verification by 67{\%}, compared to
		  NCL-X},
