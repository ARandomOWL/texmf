@article{Mokhov2010,
abstract = {Ultra low-power design and energy harvesting applications require digital systems to operate under extremely low voltages approaching the point of balance between dynamic and static power consumption which is attained in the sub-threshold operation mode. Delay variations are extremely large in this mode, which calls for the use of asynchronous circuits that are speed-independent or quasi-delay-insensitive. However, even these classes of asynchronous logic become vulnerable because certain timing assumptions commonly accepted under normal operating conditions are no longer valid. In particular, the delay of inverters, often used as the so-called inpububbles', can no longer be neglected and they have to be either removed or properly acknowledged to ensure speed-independence. This paper presents an automated approach to synthesis of robust controllers for sub-threshold digital systems based on dual-rail implementation of control logic which eliminates inverters com-pletely. This and other important properties are analysed and compared to the standard single-rail solutions. Dual-rail controllers are shown not to have signicant overheads in terms of area and power consumption and are even faster in some cases due to the elimination of inverters from critical paths. The presented automated techniques are very ecient and can be applied to very large controllers as demonstrated in benchmarks.},

@inproceedings{Zhou2006,
abstract = {Designing asynchronous circuits by reusing existing synchronous tools has become a promising solution to the problem of poor CAD support in asynchronous world. A straightforward way is to structurally map the gates in a synchronous netlist to their functionally equivalent modules which use delay-insensitive codes. Different trade-offs exist in previous methods between the overheads of the implementations and their robustness. The aim of this paper is to optimise the area of asynchronous circuits using partial acknowledgement concept. We employ this concept in two design flows, which are implemented in a software tool to evaluate the efficiency of the method. The benchmark results show the average reduction in area by 28{\%} and in the number of inter-functional module wires that require timing verification by 67{\%}, compared to NCL-X},

@article{Elia2014,
abstract = {As the need for low-power electronics increases steadily, so does the demand of asynchronous systems that can function under low and variable power conditions. In designing asynchronous logic, hand-shaking protocols are required in order to preserve a form of synchronization. The single most common method, for acknowledgment (ACK) generation, is the use of delay blocks but this can sometimes prove both unreliable and incompetent in terms of performance. The following paper proposes the design of a Register Bank with completion detection (CD) for both Read and Write operations. Simulations performed on the synthesised design provided solid results.},
