@Article{	  Mokhov2010,
  abstract	= {Ultra low-power design and energy harvesting applications
		  require digital systems to operate under extremely low
		  voltages approaching the point of balance between dynamic
		  and static power consumption which is attained in the
		  sub-threshold operation mode. Delay variations are
		  extremely large in this mode, which calls for the use of
		  asynchronous circuits that are speed-independent or
		  quasi-delay-insensitive. However, even these classes of
		  asynchronous logic become vulnerable because certain timing
		  assumptions commonly accepted under normal operating
		  conditions are no longer valid. In particular, the delay of
		  inverters, often used as the so-called inpububbles', can no
		  longer be neglected and they have to be either removed or
		  properly acknowledged to ensure speed-independence. This
		  paper presents an automated approach to synthesis of robust
		  controllers for sub-threshold digital systems based on
		  dual-rail implementation of control logic which eliminates
		  inverters com-pletely. This and other important properties
		  are analysed and compared to the standard single-rail
		  solutions. Dual-rail controllers are shown not to have
		  signicant overheads in terms of area and power consumption
		  and are even faster in some cases due to the elimination of
		  inverters from critical paths. The presented automated
		  techniques are very ecient and can be applied to very large
		  controllers as demonstrated in benchmarks.},
