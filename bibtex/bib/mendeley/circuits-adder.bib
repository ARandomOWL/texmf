  abstract	= {This article presents a general method for designing
		  delay-insensitive datapath circuits. Its emphasis is on the
		  formal derivation of a circuit from its specification. We
		  discuss the properties required in a code that is used to
		  transmit data asynchronously, and we introduce such a code.
		  We introduce a general method (in the form of a theorem)
		  for distributing the evaluation of a function over a number
		  of concurrent cells. This method requires that the code be
		  distributive. We apply the method to the familiar example
		  of a ripple-carry adder, and we give a CMOS implementation
		  of the adder.},
