  abstract	= {The roadblock to wide acceptance of asynchronous
		  methodology is poor CAD support. Current asynchronous
		  design tools require a significant re-education of
		  designers, and their capabilities are far behind
		  synchronous commercial tools. This paper considers the
		  testing methodology for a particular subclass of
		  asynchronous circuits (Null Convention Logic or NCL) that
		  entirely relies on conventional CAD tools available at
		  today's market. It is shown that for acyclic NCL pipelines
		  a test pattern generation for stuck-at faults could be
		  effectively solved through the construction and checking of
		  the synchronous circuit with a set of faults "equivalent"
		  to the original NCL circuit. This result is extended to
		  arbitrary NCL structures by applying the partial scan
		  technique to break computational loops. The method
		  guarantees 100{\%} stuck-at fault coverage in NCL systems,
		  which is confirmed by experimental data.},

  abstract	= {This work proposes asynchronous interleaved scan
		  architecture (AISA) intended for the internal structure of
		  online Built-in Self-test for Null Convention Logic (NCL)
		  circuits. NCL is a robust asynchronous paradigm which can
		  target devices for long-life missions and hard-to-access
		  environments. However, on-line self-test methods adapted to
		  match the characteristics of this important asynchronous
		  method are not available currently. Existing test hardware
		  for NCL is based on synchronous test elements. Such test
		  hardware when used for on-line testing could introduce
		  metastability issues and reduce the reliability of the
		  highly robust NCL devices. We propose a scan architecture
		  specifically designed for NCL circuits and demonstrate how
		  this can be integrated into an on-line BIST architecture.
		  Results for timing of the scan cell are shown with an
		  average area overhead of 10{\%}, which is only 35{\%} of
		  that of previous work [1]. Furthermore we do not need clock
		  trees or double latches for sync/async interfaces.},
