@PhDThesis{	  Casanova2008,
  abstract	= {This master's thesis is on the field of computer science
		  applied on electronics. The miniaturisation of integrated
		  circuits is bringing new problems in terms of power
		  consumption, speed, and variability tolerance. The current
		  synchronous designs are struggling to cope with these
		  problems, and in consequence new optimisations or paradigms
		  are being studied. The study of this thesis are the
		  optimisations like clock skew for synchronous circuits and
		  asynchronous circuits as an alternative paradigm. The
		  performance analysis of both cases are equivalent and
		  algorithms on graph theory for cycles have been implemented
		  to calculate the optimum speed. Asynchronous controllers
		  are essential for a good asynchronous design. To create a
		  connectivity structure of controllers it is necessary to
		  group the memory elements (registers) of the circuit into
		  clusters. Clustering registers affects power consumption,
		  performance, area, and variability tolerance. To produce a
		  good clus-tering is a hard job because of the high number
		  of registers and for the trade-offs of optimising all these
		  characteristics. An initial problem in clustering of
		  controllers is to decide how many controllers we want. A
		  design with one cluster give us the same problems of a
		  synchronous de-sign, high power consumption and too much
		  sensible on variability of temperature, voltage,
		  manufacturing errors, etc. On the other hand, having as
		  many controllers as registers will produce too much
		  overhead in area for all the new logic and wires that needs
		  to be added. It is important to have clusters as less
		  connected as possible to design simple controllers and to
		  minimise the impact on area. We know from benchmarks and
		  industrial designs that the register graph is highly
		  connected, and the controllers graph is almost complete. A
		  variation of Min-Cut can give us a solution to optimise
		  this property. The clustering will have an impact on
		  performance. Grouping registers implies a lost of freedom,
		  and optimisations like clock skew or the asynchronous
		  circuit will be affected by this lost as a handicap to
		  reach the maximum speed. From the placement point of view
		  we need to have clusters where their registers are close to
		  minimise the clock tree. The ideal solution is a partition
		  of the space. The worst solution is to have the registers
		  spared around. The contribution of this thesis are two
		  clustering algorithms; A local search solution to minimise
		  the number of connections, and a k-means implementation
		  that combines the minimisation of the clock trees and the
		  maximisation of performance, by using parameters to balance
		  it. These algorithms have been implemented in the Elastix
		  EDA tool and executed on ISCAS benchmarks and SUN
		  Microsystems OpenSparc processor. Acknowledgements Several

@Article{	  Liu2010,
  abstract	= {In nanoscale technologies that experience large levels of
		  process variation, post-silicon adaptation is an important
		  step in circuit design. These adaptation techniques are
		  often based on measurements of a replica of the nominal
		  critical path, whose variations are intended to reflect
		  those of the entire circuit after manufacturing. For
		  realistic circuits, where the number of critical paths can
		  be large, the notion of using a single critical path is too
		  simplistic. This paper overcomes this problem by
		  introducing the idea of synthesizing a representative
		  critical path (RCP), which captures these complexities of
		  the variations. We first prove that the requirement on the
		  RCP is that it should be highly correlated with the circuit
		  delay. Next, we present three novel algorithms to
		  automatically build the RCP. Our experimental results
		  demonstrate that over a number of samples of manufactured
		  circuits, the delay of the RCP captures the worst case
		  delay of the manufactured circuit. The average prediction
		  error of all circuits is shown to be below 2.8{\%} for all
		  three approaches. For both our approach and the critical
		  path replica method, it is essential to guard-band the
		  prediction to ensure pessimism: on average our approach
		  requires a guard band 31{\%} smaller than for the critical
		  path replica method.},
