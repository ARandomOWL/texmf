  abstract	= {There is an increasing demand for the security of
		  information over the past few decades. Random Number
		  Generators (RNGs) play a significant role in many
		  cryptographic applications for generating unpredictable
		  bit-streams. Despite the fact that Application Specific
		  Integrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation of RNGs are
		  usually preferred for their high performance, fully digital
		  circuits implemented on Field Programmable Gate Array
		  (FPGA) platforms are more attractive for designers
		  considering their ability of rapid-reconfigurable
		  prototyping, and their easy integration to other digital
		  circuits. In this study, a new improvement based on
		  irregular sampling of regular waveform is proposed for ring
		  oscillator based RNGs. It is subjected to National
		  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-22 test
		  suite and it passes full tests without any post-processing.
		  An attack circuit is also implemented to see the robustness
		  of the designed RNG against coupling-based attacks. No
		  effective correlation can be obtained between the outputs
		  of the target and the attack circuit; in spite of, their
		  extremely close placement to each other inside the FPGA
		  chip. The feasibility of the proposed method is given in
		  experimental results.},

@TechReport{	  Majzoobi,
  abstract	= {The paper presents a novel and efficient method to
		  generate true random numbers on FPGAs by inducing
		  metastability in bi-stable circuit elements, e.g.
		  flip-flops. Metastability is achieved by using precise
		  programmable delay lines (PDL) that accurately equalize the
		  signal arrival times to flip-flops. The PDLs are capable of
		  adjusting signal propagation delays with resolutions higher
		  than fractions of a pico second. In addition, a real time
		  monitoring system is utilized to assure a high degree of
		  randomness in the generated output bits, resilience against
		  fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as
		  robustness against active adversarial attacks. The
		  monitoring system employs a feedback loop that actively
		  monitors the probability of output bits; as soon as any
		  bias is observed in probabilities, it adjusts the delay
		  through PDLs to return to the metastable operation region.
		  Implementation on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGAs and results of NIST
		  randomness tests show the effectiveness of our approach.},
