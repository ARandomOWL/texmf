@TechReport{	  Majzoobi,
  abstract	= {The paper presents a novel and efficient method to
		  generate true random numbers on FPGAs by inducing
		  metastability in bi-stable circuit elements, e.g.
		  flip-flops. Metastability is achieved by using precise
		  programmable delay lines (PDL) that accurately equalize the
		  signal arrival times to flip-flops. The PDLs are capable of
		  adjusting signal propagation delays with resolutions higher
		  than fractions of a pico second. In addition, a real time
		  monitoring system is utilized to assure a high degree of
		  randomness in the generated output bits, resilience against
		  fluctuations in environmental conditions, as well as
		  robustness against active adversarial attacks. The
		  monitoring system employs a feedback loop that actively
		  monitors the probability of output bits; as soon as any
		  bias is observed in probabilities, it adjusts the delay
		  through PDLs to return to the metastable operation region.
		  Implementation on Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGAs and results of NIST
		  randomness tests show the effectiveness of our approach.},
