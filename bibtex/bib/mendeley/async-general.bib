  abstract	= {Delay-insensitive dual-rail and bundled data design
		  methodologies are the two main approaches used for the
		  creation of asynchronous circuits. Bundled data allows the
		  creation of fast, low overhead circuits, whereas dual-rail
		  allows bit-level pipelining and average case performance.
		  This paper describes 'Early output' logic, which combines
		  the positive features of the two methods to create faster
		  asynchronous circuits. This method allows the creation of
		  circuits yielding performance faster than their synchronous
		  counterparts. Early output implementations allow logic to
		  evaluate results before all inputs are presented. The
		  results move to the next stage, but the current stage
		  stalls while waiting for the late inputs to arrive simply
		  to acknowledge them. This unnecessary wait can be removed
		  by allowing backwards propagating 'Anti-Tokens' to remove
		  the late inputs. The use of anti-tokens and improved
		  semi-decoupled latches allows the removal of many stalls
		  due to unnecessary synchronisations, thus improving the
		  performance of the circuit.},

  abstract	= {The growing variability and complexity of advanced CMOS
		  technologies makes the physical design of clocked logic in
		  large Systems-on-Chip more and more challenging.
		  Asynchronous logic has been studied for many years and
		  become an attractive solution for a broad range of
		  applications, from massively parallel multi-media systems
		  to systems with ultra-low power {\&} low-noise constraints,
		  like cryptography, energy autonomous systems, and
		  sensor-network nodes. The objective of this embedded
		  tutorial is to give a comprehensive and recent overview of
		  asynchronous logic. The tutorial will cover the basic
		  principles and advantages of asynchronous logic, some
		  insights on new research challenges, and will present the
		  GALS scheme as an intermediate design style with recent
		  results in asynchronous Network-on-Chip for future Many
		  Core architectures. Regarding industrial acceptance, recent
		  asynchronous logic applications within the microelectronics
		  industry will be presented, with a main focus on the
		  commercial CAD tools available today.},
