  abstract	= {The growing variability and complexity of advanced CMOS
		  technologies makes the physical design of clocked logic in
		  large Systems-on-Chip more and more challenging.
		  Asynchronous logic has been studied for many years and
		  become an attractive solution for a broad range of
		  applications, from massively parallel multi-media systems
		  to systems with ultra-low power {\&} low-noise constraints,
		  like cryptography, energy autonomous systems, and
		  sensor-network nodes. The objective of this embedded
		  tutorial is to give a comprehensive and recent overview of
		  asynchronous logic. The tutorial will cover the basic
		  principles and advantages of asynchronous logic, some
		  insights on new research challenges, and will present the
		  GALS scheme as an intermediate design style with recent
		  results in asynchronous Network-on-Chip for future Many
		  Core architectures. Regarding industrial acceptance, recent
		  asynchronous logic applications within the microelectronics
		  industry will be presented, with a main focus on the
		  commercial CAD tools available today.},
