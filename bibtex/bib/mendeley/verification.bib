  abstract	= {Asynchronous NULL convention logic (NCL) circuits are
		  dual-rail quasi-delay-insensitive circuits that have many
		  applications in high radiation and extreme temperature
		  fluctuation environments such as space exploration. Two
		  abstraction techniques are proposed that can be used to
		  drastically improve the efficiency and scalability of
		  formal equivalence verification targeted at NCL circuits.
		  The effectiveness of the abstraction techniques have been
		  demonstrated using a number of multiply and accumulate
		  circuit benchmarks.},
