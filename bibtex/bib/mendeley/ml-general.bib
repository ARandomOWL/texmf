  abstract	= {In today's world, ruled by a great amount of data and
		  mobile devices, cloud-based systems are spreading all over.
		  Such phenomenon increases the number of connected devices,
		  broadcast bandwidth, and information exchange. These
		  fine-grained interconnected systems, which enable the
		  Internet connectivity for an extremely large number of
		  facilities (far beyond the current number of devices) go by
		  the name of Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario,
		  mobile devices have an operating time which is proportional
		  to the battery capacity, the number of operations performed
		  per cycle and the amount of exchanged data. Since the
		  transmission of data to a central cloud represents a very
		  energy-hungry operation, new computational paradigms have
		  been implemented. The computation is not completely
		  performed in the cloud, distributing the power load among
		  the nodes of the system, and data are compressed to reduce
		  the transmitted power requirements. In the edge-computing
		  paradigm, part of the computational power is moved toward
		  data collection sources, and, only after a first
		  elaboration, collected data are sent to the central cloud
		  server. Indeed, the "edge" term refers to the extremities
		  of systems represented by IoT devices. This survey paper
		  presents the hardware architectures of typical IoT devices
		  and sums up many of the low power techniques which make
		  them appealing for a large scale of applications. An
		  overview of the newest research topics is discussed,
		  besides a final example of a complete functioning system,
		  embedding all the introduced features.},
