		  Description Language (Verilog HDL) to an asynchronous
		  Control Unit and a synchronous Data Path. The Control Unit,
		  specified as a Signal Transition Graph, can be implemented
		  using research-oriented asynchronous synthesis tools. The
		  Data Path, specified using the Synthesizable Subset of
		  Verilog, can be implemented using state-of-the-art
		  commercial synchronous synthesis tools. Our compiler
		  integrates in a fully automated manner source parsing,
		  control/data splitting, managing the design and inserting
		  matched delays for data bundling constraints. It can be
		  used to produce asynchronous designs in an Application
		  Specific Integrated Circuit design style, since the result
		  is a netlist of standard cells ready for physical design.
		  We describe a simple example of compilation and its
		  results, and we discuss some outstanding issues in the
		  domain of asynchronous Control Unit synthesis},

@InProceedings{	  Blunno2004,
  abstract	= {This paper discusses how Pipefitter, a tool chain that
		  implements a fully automated synthesis flow for
		  asynchronous circuits, can be used to design a simple
		  asynchronous microcontroller. The use of register transfer
		  level (RTL)-like Verilog hardware description languages
		  (HDL) as the input format makes the first steps of the
		  design flow (i.e., specification and simulation) very easy
		  for the designer. Pipefitter directly synthesizes the
		  control unit as a hazard-free standard cell netlist, uses a
		  genetic algorithm to perform binding and multiplexer
		  optimization for the datapath and allows the user to
		  manually specify the binding. It also produces a
		  synthesizable Verilog specification for the datapath, as
		  well as a set of scripts driving both its synthesis and
		  timing analysis by state-of-the-art commercial synchronous
		  RTL and logic synthesis tools. The automated insertion of
		  matched delays completes the logic design, and hands off
		  the netlist to the standard cell-based layout tools. The
		  example presented in this brief, shows how Pipefitter can
		  be effectively used for the design of asynchronous
		  application specific integrated circuits.},

@Article{	  Chang2013,
  abstract	= {Microcontrollers play a vital role in embodying
		  intelligence into battery-powered everyday objects to
		  realize the internet of things (IoT). The desirable
		  attributes of such a microcontroller and the like include
		  high energy and area efficiency, and robust error-free
		  operation under dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), workload,
		  process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation effects.
		  In this work, a synchronous-logic (S 8051) and a
		  quasi-delay-insensitive asynchronous-logic (A 8051) 8051
		  microcontroller core are designed and fabricated for
		  full-range DVS from nominal VDD to deep sub-threshold. The
		  performance of the S 8051 and A 8051 are largely comparable
		  at nominal conditions and the entire DVS range, but differs
		  when PVT and workload are varied. At nominal VDD, both the
		  microcontroller cores feature comparable energy and speed,
		  with the electromagnetic interference of the A 8051 {\~{}}
		  12 dB lower and the area {\~{}} 2 × larger than the S
		  8051. When DVS is applied, both the microcontroller cores
		  feature comparable energy and speed; the S 8051 requires
		  simultaneous adjustment of clock frequency with VDD. At
		  wide PVT variations, up to {\~{}} 12 × delay margins are
		  required for the S 8051, whereas the A 8051 operates at
		  actual speed. When the workload of both microcontrollers is
		  varied, the A 8051 features lower energy dissipation per
		  workload due to the exploitation of its asynchronous-logic
		  protocols. For IoT applications that incur wide PVT and
		  workload variations, A 8051 is more suitable due to its
		  self-timed nature, whereas when PVT and workload variations
		  are less severe, S 8051 is more suitable due to a smaller
		  IC area.},
