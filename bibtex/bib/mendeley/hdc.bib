  abstract	= {Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing
		  framework that takes inspiration from attributes of
		  neuronal circuits such as hyperdimensionality, fully
		  distributed holographic representation, and
		  (pseudo)randomness. When employed for machine learning
		  tasks such as learning and classification, HDC involves
		  manipulation and comparison of large patterns within
		  memory. Moreover, a key attribute of HDC is its robustness
		  to the imperfections associated with the computational
		  substrates on which it is implemented. It is therefore
		  particularly amenable to emerging non-von Neumann paradigms
		  such as in-memory computing, where the physical attributes
		  of nanoscale memristive devices are exploited to perform
		  computation in place. Here, we present a complete in-memory
		  HDC system that achieves a near-optimum trade-off between
		  design complexity and classification accuracy based on
		  three prototypical HDC related learning tasks, namely,
		  language classification, news classification, and hand
		  gesture recognition from electromyography signals.
		  Comparable accuracies to software implementations are
		  demonstrated, experimentally, using 760,000 phase-change
		  memory devices performing analog in-memory computing.},
