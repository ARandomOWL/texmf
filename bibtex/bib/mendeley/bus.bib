abstract = {By presenting the design of an asynchronous bus in-terface for the 80C.51 microcontroller we show that non-channel communications are needed to come to a modular and eflcient solution. We derive the bus design by applying five transformations to an initial design that is completely based on channel communications. In each of the steps we first discuss the problem to be solved. The final design uses both channel and non-channel communications, the latter kind of communications being based on shared variables. In principle, communicating through variables is less safe than communicating through channels. We propose so-called communication sessions to obtain safe commu-nications through variables. Communication sessions are well-defined periods of time during which the access rights with respect to a set of variables are transferred from one activity to anothel: We also show that such sessions can be implemented using conventional channels.},

@article{Bainbridge,
abstract = {This paper introduces MARBLE, the Manchester Asyn-chRonous Bus for Low Energy, a two channel mi-cropipeline bus with centralized arbitration and address decoding which provides for the interconnection of asyn-chronous VLSI macrocells. In addition to basic bus func-tionality, MARBLE supports bus-bridging and test access, demonstrating that all the functions of a high speed macro-cell bus can be implemented efficiently in a fully asyn-chronous design style. MARBLE is used in the AMULET3i microprocessor to connect the CPU core and DMA controller to RAM, ROM and peripherals. It exploits pipelining of the arbitration, address and data cycles, together with spatial locality op-timizations and in-order split transfers, to supply the band-width requirements of such a system. The design of a MAR-BLE initiator data interface used in the AMULET3i is pre-sented, including a Petri-net specification suitable for syn-thesis using the Petrify tool.},

@article{Molina,
abstract = {In this paper the design of a dual rail asynchronous system bus is presented. Buses are generally avoided in asynchronous design because it is dificult to meet the isochronic fork assumption on heavily loaded wires. Our bus design avoids this assumption and provides a quasi delay-insensitive solution. The proposed solution makes a system modular and scaleable by guaranteeing that the complexity of the system grows linearly with each module added.},
