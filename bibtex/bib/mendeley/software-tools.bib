  abstract	= {The Balsa synthesis system is presented. Balsa generates
		  purely asynchronous macromodular circuits from CSP-like
		  descriptions similar to those of Philips' Tangram tool.
		  Balsa targets standard-cell and FPGA technologies by
		  producing gate level netlists. Place and route can be
		  performed with existing commercial tools. The DMA
		  con-troller for the AMULET3i asynchronous micropro-cessor
		  macrocell is presented as a proof of design flow. AMULET3i
		  is to be fabricated in 0.35 Âµm 3LM CMOS. Silicon is due to
		  be received in August 2000.},

@InProceedings{	  Blunno2004,
  abstract	= {This paper discusses how Pipefitter, a tool chain that
		  implements a fully automated synthesis flow for
		  asynchronous circuits, can be used to design a simple
		  asynchronous microcontroller. The use of register transfer
		  level (RTL)-like Verilog hardware description languages
		  (HDL) as the input format makes the first steps of the
		  design flow (i.e., specification and simulation) very easy
		  for the designer. Pipefitter directly synthesizes the
		  control unit as a hazard-free standard cell netlist, uses a
		  genetic algorithm to perform binding and multiplexer
		  optimization for the datapath and allows the user to
		  manually specify the binding. It also produces a
		  synthesizable Verilog specification for the datapath, as
		  well as a set of scripts driving both its synthesis and
		  timing analysis by state-of-the-art commercial synchronous
		  RTL and logic synthesis tools. The automated insertion of
		  matched delays completes the logic design, and hands off
		  the netlist to the standard cell-based layout tools. The
		  example presented in this brief, shows how Pipefitter can
		  be effectively used for the design of asynchronous
		  application specific integrated circuits.},
