abstract = {With ever increasing power density and temperature variations within high density VLSI chips, it is very important to study the temperature effects on the devices in a compact way and to predict their scaling. In this paper, the sub-threshold leakage power analysis of the P3 and P4 SRAM cells has been carried out at a temperature range from -25 0 C to +125 0 C. It has been observed that the sub-threshold leakage and the standby power dissipation increases with increase in temperature. However, due to the stacked pMOS design used in P4 and P3 SRAM cells, minimum sub-threshold leakage and standby leakage power is observed as compared to the conventional 6T design.},
