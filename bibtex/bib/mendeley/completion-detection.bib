abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for efficient distribution of completion detection blocks in a dual-rail self-timed circuit to ensure correct computation of the completion signal. Layer-wise optimisation technique is used with the width of layers selected so as to satisfy timing constrains and use the least possible number of completion detection blocks.},
