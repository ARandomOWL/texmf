  abstract	= {In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a
		  monolithic 3D implementation of an asynchronous AES
		  encryption core can achieve up to 50.3{\%} footprint
		  reduction, 25.7{\%} improvement in power, 34.3{\%} shorter
		  wire length and 6.06{\%} reduced cell area compared to its
		  2D counterpart, at identical (ISO) performance. We also
		  demonstrate that combining asynchronous circuits with 3D
		  integration can yield a peak power reduction of 63.9{\%}
		  compared to the equivalent synchronous realisation. We also
		  verified that the asynchronous implementation of the
		  encryption core is more tolerant to monolithic 3D tier-tier
		  variation compared to its synchronous counterpart. To the
		  best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss
		  the mutual benefits of asynchronous and monolithic 3D IC
		  integration.},
