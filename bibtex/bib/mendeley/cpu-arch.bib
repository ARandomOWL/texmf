abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely predicted to comprise billions of connected devices, many of which will be wireless sensor nodes (WSN). Energy efficiency is a huge challenge here, followed by node cost and ease of software (SW) development. Addressing all of the above, this paper presents an 11.7 pJ/cycle subthreshold ARM Cortex-M0+ WSN processing subsystem implemented in low-leakage 65 nm CMOS. Voltage and frequency scalability is from 850 nW active power at 250 mV to 66 MHz above 900 mV, with a fully integrated 82{\%} peak-efficiency voltage regulator for direct-battery operation, and supporting 80 nW CPU and RAM state-retention power gating for SW transparent leakage reduction. SW and system optimization approaches are described and a {\textless}formula{\textgreater} {\textless}img src="/images/tex/32259.gif" alt="2.94;up$\backslash$mu W"{\textgreater} {\textless}/formula{\textgreater} SW ECG workload is presented.},

abstract = {Power  consumption  constraints  became  critical  issue  in  microprocessor  development. 
Active  research  is  taking  place  to  try  and  optimize  this  problem. 
This  project  tackles  power 
constraint  problem  by  further  exploring  fairly  recently 
$\mu$System  Research  Group  a
t  Newcastle 
University
introduced  Instruction  Set  Architecture  design  flow,  which  is  based  on  novel 
formalism  called  Conditional  Partial  Order  Graphs.  Study  objective  is  to  further  explore  this 
design  flow by applying
its
methodology
to ARM Cortex M0+  Inst
ruction Set. 
Implementation 
of  this  design  flow  is  split  into  four  major  parts  and  completed  as  follows:  specification  of 
instruction  set,  scenarios  encoding,  CPOG  generation  and  mapping  process. 
Throughout  this 
project some interesting 
results
were obtain
ed, but 
highlight 
was very compact represe
ntation of 
ARM Instruction Set. Investigation of link between size of control logic and instruction set, also 
importance  of  encoding  were  analyzed  and  discussed.  Project  was  concluded  with 
discussion 
regarding 
its 
objectives, and whether they were accomplished or not.},
