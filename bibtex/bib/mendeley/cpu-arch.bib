		  recently $\mu$System Research Group a t Newcastle
		  University introduced Instruction Set Architecture design
		  flow, which is based on novel formalism called Conditional
		  Partial Order Graphs. Study objective is to further explore
		  this design flow by applying its methodology to ARM Cortex
		  M0+ Inst ruction Set. Implementation of this design flow is
		  split into four major parts and completed as follows:
		  specification of instruction set, scenarios encoding, CPOG
		  generation and mapping process. Throughout this project
		  some interesting results were obtain ed, but highlight was
		  very compact represe ntation of ARM Instruction Set.
		  Investigation of link between size of control logic and
		  instruction set, also importance of encoding were analyzed
		  and discussed. Project was concluded with discussion
		  regarding its objectives, and whether they were
		  accomplished or not.},
