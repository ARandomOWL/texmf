  abstract	= {— In this paper a novel completion detection method for
		  self-timed, asynchronous subthreshold circuits is
		  presented. By employing the self-timed operation principle,
		  substantial speed gains in the operation of the
		  asynchronous pipelines can be realized. The completion
		  detection system is very simple, con-sisting of a sensor
		  transistor, a very basic AC-coupled amplifier and a
		  monostable multivibrator. The proposed method can be easily
		  integrated into the CMOS design flow. The advantages of the
		  proposed completion detection system is shown through
		  simulations on an 16-bit ripple carry adder in a standard
		  0.18µm CMOS process operating at 400mV supply voltage. I.
		  INTRODUCTION Power density and power consumption of complex
		  digital systems has become a major concern during the
		  recent years, both due to thermal concerns and due to
		  limited battery life-time in mobile applications. Any
		  significant reduction in power dissipation can only be
		  achieved by lowering the operating voltage of the circuits.
		  This would be possible by relaxing the constraints of
		  classical strong-inversion operation of MOS-FETs, and by
		  accepting the notion that transistors can (and will) be
		  operated well below threshold, in the subthreshold
		  (weak-inversion) regime. In subthreshold mode of operation,
		  the supply voltage can be scaled aggressively and power
		  dissipation can be decreased significantly. There are
		  successful implementations of digital circuits working in
		  the subthreshold region [1]–[3] and tech-niques to
		  improve the performance of subthreshold CMOS circuits have
		  also been proposed [4]. Subthreshold operation of static
		  CMOS logic has been analytically analyzed using the EKV
		  model in [5]. According to the analysis, to benefit the
		  most from the subthreshold operation, the logic circuits
		  should be run at their maximum operating frequency with an
		  activity factor $\alpha$ as close to 1 as possible.
		  Maximizing $\alpha$ is non-trivial in synchronous circuits.
		  Be-cause of the fixed time slot for computation,
		  data-dependent processing times cannot be exploited in
		  synchronous opera-tion. Also in a synchronous system, power
		  is consumed with each clock transition regardless of the
		  data or state change. Although clock gating has been
		  proposed as a solution to this problem [6], it cannot
		  provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of
		  data-dependent computation times. On the other hand,
		  asynchronous circuits do not consume clocking power and
		  have the potential of operating with tunable voltage
		  supplies at an $\alpha$ factor of 1 at the optimum supply
		  voltage. In},

  abstract	= {Microcontrollers play a vital role in embodying
		  intelligence into battery-powered everyday objects to
		  realize the internet of things (IoT). The desirable
		  attributes of such a microcontroller and the like include
		  high energy and area efficiency, and robust error-free
		  operation under dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), workload,
		  process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation effects.
		  In this work, a synchronous-logic (S 8051) and a
		  quasi-delay-insensitive asynchronous-logic (A 8051) 8051
		  microcontroller core are designed and fabricated for
		  full-range DVS from nominal VDD to deep sub-threshold. The
		  performance of the S 8051 and A 8051 are largely comparable
		  at nominal conditions and the entire DVS range, but differs
		  when PVT and workload are varied. At nominal VDD, both the
		  microcontroller cores feature comparable energy and speed,
		  with the electromagnetic interference of the A 8051 {\~{}}
		  12 dB lower and the area {\~{}} 2 × larger than the S
		  8051. When DVS is applied, both the microcontroller cores
		  feature comparable energy and speed; the S 8051 requires
		  simultaneous adjustment of clock frequency with VDD. At
		  wide PVT variations, up to {\~{}} 12 × delay margins are
		  required for the S 8051, whereas the A 8051 operates at
		  actual speed. When the workload of both microcontrollers is
		  varied, the A 8051 features lower energy dissipation per
		  workload due to the exploitation of its asynchronous-logic
		  protocols. For IoT applications that incur wide PVT and
		  workload variations, A 8051 is more suitable due to its
		  self-timed nature, whereas when PVT and workload variations
		  are less severe, S 8051 is more suitable due to a smaller
		  IC area.},
