abstract = {Energy becomes the most critical aspect in the design of modern microelectronic devices, which is re-flected in the increasing number of conflicting requirements to the power characteristics of the circuits. How-ever, modern design tools do not consider dynamics of energy resource, do not have flexible notion of energy efficiency and limit power optimisation to few design-specific techniques. We propose to address these limita-tions through a fundamental token-based model of computation, extended with the concept of energy tokens to represent energy flows in the circuit. The energy token model will serve as a foundation for building systems in such a way that while maintaining functional equivalence, their operation will be altered to meet energy mode requirements under dynamically changing energy resource and operating conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for efficient distribution of completion detection blocks in a dual-rail self-timed circuit to ensure correct computation of the completion signal. Layer-wise optimisation technique is used with the width of layers selected so as to satisfy timing constrains and use the least possible number of completion detection blocks.},
