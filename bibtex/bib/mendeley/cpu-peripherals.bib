  abstract	= {â€”Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
		  implements serial communication between peripherals and
		  remote embedded systems. The UART protocol is defined based
		  on fixed frequencies with a sampling method to achieve
		  robustness under reasonable frequency variations between
		  systems. Such design specifications are natural for clocked
		  domains. This work investigates whether this simple clocked
		  hardware protocol can be advantageously implemented using
		  asynchronous design techniques. A full duplex clocked and
		  asynchronous UART are implemented and compared. The
		  asynchronous design results in average power of about
		  one-fourth that of the clocked design under standard
		  operating modes.},
