@Article{	  Shafik,
  abstract	= {The traditional hallmark in embedded systems is to
		  minimize energy consumption considering hard or soft
		  real-time deadlines. The basic principle is to transfigure
		  the uncer-tainties of task execution times in the real
		  world into energy saving opportunities. The energy saving
		  is achieved by suitably controlling the reliable power
		  supply at circuit or system-level with the aim of
		  minimizing the slack times, while meeting the specified
		  performance requirements. Computing paradigm for emerging
		  ubiquitous systems, par-ticularly for the energy-harvested
		  ones, has clearly shifted from the traditional systems. The
		  energy supply of these systems can vary temporally and
		  spatially within a dynamic range, essentially making
		  computation extremely challenging. Such a paradigm shift
		  requires disruptive approaches to design com-puting systems
		  that can provide continued functionality under unreliable
		  supply power envelope and operate with autonomous
		  survivability (i.e. the ability to automatically guarantee
		  retention and/or completion of a given computation task).
		  In this paper, we introduce Real-Power Computing, inspired
		  by the above trends and tenets. We show how computation
		  systems must be designed with power-proportionality to
		  achieve sustained computation and survivability when
		  operating at extreme power conditions. We present extensive
		  analysis of the need for this new computing approach using
		  definitions, where necessary, coupled with detailed
		  taxonomies, empirical observations, a review of relevant
		  research works and example scenarios using three case
		  studies representing the proposed paradigm. I. COMPUTING IS
		  CHANGING Over the years, computing systems have found their
		  usage in a large number of domains. Considering their
		  typical power consumptions, these domains can be roughly
		  categorized into six major applications, such as high-end
		  many-core server systems, desktop computing, portable
		  computing, mobile sys-tems, embedded systems and low-end
		  ubiquitous systems. Fig. 1 depicts four different trends of
		  these applications: design and optimization requirements,
		  expected/current population of these systems, power supply
		  variations and energy effi-ciency requirements by them.
		  These trends show how design considerations have evolved
		  with power and/or performance constraints for different
		  application domains, highlighting their degree of usage in
		  terms of device populations. For line supply powered
		  computing applications, such as high-end server and desktop
		  computing systems, performance is typically constrained by
		  power consumption (which ranges from tens of watts to
		  several mega-watts) to control the operational costs and
		  system overheating [4]. For battery-powered systems, such
		  as portable computing devices and embedded systems (with
		  typical power from a few milliwatts R. Shafik and A.
