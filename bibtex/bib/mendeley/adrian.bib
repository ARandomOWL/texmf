		  self-timed dual-rail circuits which introduces a timing
		  assumption in the return-to-spacer phase. The design flow
		  enables power proportionality and is demonstrated through
		  the design of a 32-bit ripple-carry adder and a 32-bit
		  comparator for internet of things applications. The designs
		  are synthesized to a 65 nm cell library with
		  state-of-the-art transistor sizing for subthreshold.
		  Simulation results show improved performance and energy per
		  computation across operating conditions compared with
		  single-rail equivalents. The design flow allows extension
		  of the power proportional philosophy to a wider range of
		  circuits.},

@Article{	  Wheeldon2020b,
  abstract	= {Energy efficiency continues to be the core design
		  challenge for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware
		  designers. In this paper, we propose a new AI hardware
		  architecture targeting Internet of Things applications. The
		  architecture is founded on the principle of learning
		  automata, defined using propositional logic. The
		  logic-based underpinning enables low-energy footprints as
		  well as high learning accuracy during training and
		  inference, which are crucial requirements for efficient AI
		  with long operating life. We present the first insights
		  into this new architecture in the form of a custom-designed
		  integrated circuit for pervasive applications. Fundamental
		  to this circuit is systematic encoding of binarized input
		  data fed into maximally parallel logic blocks. The
		  allocation of these blocks is optimized through a design
		  exploration and automation flow using field programmable
		  gate array-based fast prototypes and software simulations.
		  The design flow allows for an expedited hyperparameter
		  search for meeting the conflicting requirements of energy
		  frugality and high accuracy. Extensive validations on the
		  hardware implementation of the new architecture using
		  single- and multi-class machine learning datasets show
		  potential for significantly lower energy than the existing
		  AI hardware architectures. In addition, we demonstrate test
		  accuracy and robustness matching the software
		  implementation, outperforming other state-of-the-art
		  machine learning algorithms. This article is part of the
		  theme issue 'Advanced electromagnetic non-destructive
		  evaluation and smart monitoring'.},
