  abstract	= {This work presents a design flow for asynchronous,
		  self-timed dual-rail circuits which introduces a timing
		  assumption in the return-to-spacer phase. The design flow
		  enables power proportionality and is demonstrated through
		  the design of a 32-bit ripple-carry adder and a 32-bit
		  comparator for internet of things applications. The designs
		  are synthesized to a 65 nm cell library with
		  state-of-the-art transistor sizing for subthreshold.
		  Simulation results show improved performance and energy per
		  computation across operating conditions compared with
		  single-rail equivalents. The design flow allows extension
		  of the power proportional philosophy to a wider range of
		  circuits.},
